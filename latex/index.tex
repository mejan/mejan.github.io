Library for analyzing Starcraft 2 maps by region decomposition. Based on the \href{http://bwem.sourceforge.net/}{\tt Brood War Easy Map architecture} created by Igor Dimitrijevic. It uses the M\+IT license.

\subsection*{Getting started}

Demo for Commandcenter https\+://gitlab.com/\+Over\+Starcraft/\+Overseer/blob/master/demo/commandcenter.\+md \char`\"{}is found here.\char`\"{} Which is a very short demo just to get started.

Include the file {\ttfamily \hyperlink{MapImpl_8h_source}{Map\+Impl.\+h}} into your project to get started.

{\ttfamily \#include \char`\"{}\+Overseer/src/\+Map\+Impl.\+h\char`\"{}}

You need to pass a pointer to your Agent to the map to have it fully configured. Then you need to call {\ttfamily Intialize()} to construct the map. Now you\textquotesingle{}re good to go! This is how it would look on Interloper LE


\begin{DoxyCode}
\{c++\}
\{
    Overseer::MapImpl map;

    map.setBot(&bot); //Pass a pointer to your sc2::Agent
    map.Initialize(); //Intialize the map

    std::cout << "Number of tiles on map: " << map.size() << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Number of regions: " << map.getRegions().size() << std::endl;
\}
\end{DoxyCode}


Example output\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
Number of tiles on map: 26752
Number of regions: 18
\end{DoxyCode}


If you want the number of {\ttfamily Choke\+Point} you have to check for each region pair since a pair of regions could have multiple {\ttfamily Choke\+Point}
